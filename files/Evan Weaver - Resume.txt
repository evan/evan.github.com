PROVEN LEADERSHIP IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

I am a software engineer and manager, living in San Francisco. As an engineer, I
specialize in performance analysis and web scalability. As a manager, I focus on
team-building and delivering software in limited-resource environments--a kind
of human performance engineering.

I have recruited and hired dozens of candidates, negotiated and closed
multi-million dollar business deals, reorganized teams, mentored staff facing
career and personal issues, rescued other managers' projects, and led "all hands
on deck" crisis responses to successful completion.
