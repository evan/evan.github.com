PROVEN LEADERSHIP IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

I am a software engineer, manager, and entrepreneur, living in Berkeley. As an
engineer, I specialize in performance analysis and web scalability. As a
manager, I focus on team-building and delivering quality software in
limited-resource environments--a kind of human performance engineering.

I've designed, built, and maintained server-side software at all levels of
scale, including distributed databases, caching architectures, VM garbage
collectors, object mappers, and domain-specific business functions. I've
developed practical, innovative algorithms that were later validated by academic
research.

I have recruited and hired dozens of candidates, negotiated and closed
multi-million dollar business deals, performed and responded to due diligence
evaluations, created pitch decks, reorganized teams, mentored staff facing
career and personal issues, rescued other managers' projects, and led "all hands
on deck" crisis responses to successful completion.
